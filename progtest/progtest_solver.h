/**
 * Problem solver provided by the progtest environment. Solves a batch of problems. The solvers is technically
 * a subclasses of the base CProgtestSolver class, the factory functions below are used to create the instances.
 *
 * Each instance of the solver has a certain capacity - the solver solves a batch of problems at most of that size.
 * You are expected to fill the solver with problem instances, you may add any number of instances smaller than or
 * equal to the capacity. Subsequently, you are expected to call the solve() method to start the computation.
 * Each solver needs one or more threads to call the solve () method simultaneously. The computation starts once
 * the required number of threads calls method solve (). The solver then processes all stored problems and fills
 * the corresponding field in the COrder instances.
 *
 * If you need to solve further problems, you are free to create further CProgtestSolver instances. Moreover, you may
 * call solve () at any moment before the capacity of a CProgtestSolver is exceeded. That is, you may even add just
 * one COrder instance and call solve ().
 *
 * There are, however, some pitfalls. The progtest solver is a bit moody. It is aware of the test data and it knows
 * there will be N problems in the test. Moreover, it decides to create only k useful instances (k is a certain integer).
 * The created instances set their capacities to m1, m2, m3, ..., mk. The total sum is M = m1+m2+m3+ ... + mk and the
 * solver guarantees that M is equal to N or a bit greater than N.
 *
 * In other words, the solver is able to solve all problems in the test, however, you may not waste the capacity of
 * the solver instances. If you do so, you may run out of the total solver capacity.
 *
 * As stated above, the solver only creates k useful instances. If you want to create more than k instances, the
 * subsequent calls to createProgtestSolver() will return an empty smart pointer, a solved that fills-in invalid
 * results, or a solver with zero capacity (as stated above, the solver is moody/playful). Either way, the extra solver
 * instances are not very useful.
